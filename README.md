# 🚀 Executive Overview

OBSIDIAN-8 V3 is a fully systems-engineered 8-legged autonomous spider platform designed for:

- 🌄 Extreme terrain traversal  
- 🧗 Stair ascent and descent  
- 🔄 Load redistribution under actuator loss  
- 🌐 Distributed swarm coordination  
- 🔋 Energy-aware mission planning  
- 🛡 Layered fault containment  
- 🏭 Persistent industrial deployment  

This repository represents a structured robotics architecture baseline — not a prototype experiment.

Architecture is frozen at V3.  
Execution depth now expands from that foundation.

# 🕷 Why Eight Legs?

Quadrupeds balance.  
Hexapods adapt.  
**Octopods endure.**

The 8-leg configuration enables:

- ✔ Tripod gait redundancy  
- ✔ Passive stability during partial failure  
- ✔ Dynamic center-of-gravity redistribution  
- ✔ Stable neutral stance under load  
- ✔ Enhanced stair & obstacle negotiation  
- ✔ Mechanical survivability in real terrain  

Resilience is engineered into morphology.

# 🛡 Distributed Control Authority Model

OBSIDIAN-8 does not rely on a fragile centralized controller.

It implements:

- 🧠 Compute role separation  
- ❤️ Heartbeat supervision protocol  
- 🚨 Authority escalation model  
- 🔌 Watchdog kill-line architecture  
- 🧯 Fault containment boundaries  
- ⚡ Reactive core isolation

# 🧬 Design Philosophy

> Survivability through architecture.

Redundancy in mechanics.  
Containment in control.  
Energy intelligence in autonomy.  
Scalability in networking.  
Lifecycle planning from inception.

Movement is easy.  
Sustained autonomous operation is not.

---

# 🔥 Long-Term Vision

To develop a scalable family of resilient 8-legged autonomous platforms capable of:

- Persistent deployment  
- Coordinated swarm operation  
- Field survivability  
- Industrial-grade governance  
- Long-duration missions  

Architecture first.  
Execution next.  
Scale deliberately.
